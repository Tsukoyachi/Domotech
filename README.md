# Feature :
- [x] Functional base with automated light, heat, and aeration
- [x] Make functional website to view sensor values, control the house and modify the thermostat

# Future ideas :
- [ ] Add a function to change the threshold values for lighting and gas concentration
- [ ] Add a button on the website to reset each value modified by the user
- [ ] Add a routine system to say for example at what time the algorithm should stop running or what behaviour it should have when the user wakes up
- [ ] Add a control of the entrance door via digicode and a camera system visible from the website
